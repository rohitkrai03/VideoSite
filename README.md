# VideoSite
Videosite - A webpage playing video in background with sidebar playlist using Bigvideo.js.



Fullscreen Background Video Website With Animated Sidebar

This is a simple implementation of BigVideo.js playlist on a website. 
There is a sidebar which is animated on Page load and contains the playlist of videos. 
On clicking on the video links a video is played on backgroound. 

It contains multiformated videolist for browser fallback support. 
In addition to the normal functionality of BigVideo.js, there is an auto-hide script which makes the content fades out away when you stop moving the mouse (unless you are over the playlist nav).

Also using Modernizr's touch feature detection rules for how BigVideo behaves for touchscreen devices that likely do not allow autoplay is implemented.
